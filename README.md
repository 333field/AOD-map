# "Architecture of Doom" Map Project

"Architecture of Doom" is a Tumblr blog that explores buildings in disrepair, brutalist, desolate, and totalitarian architecture. 
This project will focus on improving the Map "Architecture of Doom" currently uses, created with Google My Maps. The map offers a unique way of exploring architecture in an exciting way, more interactive way than a usual blog.
