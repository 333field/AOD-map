# "Architecture of Doom" Map Project

"Architecture of Doom" is a Tumblr blog that explores buildings in disrepair, brutalist, desolate, and totalitarian architecture. 
This project will focus on improving the Map "Architecture of Doom" currently uses, created with Google My Maps. The map offers a unique way of exploring architecture in an exciting way, more interactive way than a usual blog.


### Goal

The current goal is to improve the user experience, user interface as well as widen the range of features the map offers for users as well as maintainers of the blog by rebuilding the map from scratch. All content featured on the current map will be included in the new map.

### Built Using

- Javascript, HTML, CSS
- Leaflet.js
- Stamen tiles
